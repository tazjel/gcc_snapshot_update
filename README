This shell script fetches the latest weekly build (snapshot) of GCC.
It also fetches the latest GDB snapshot. It does these things all by
itself:

* Get the tar balls from FTP sites
* Extract them
* Configure, make, make install

You need to change the paths at the top of the script for your own
needs.
