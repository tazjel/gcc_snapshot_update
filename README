This shell script automates the compilation of the latest snapshot 
of various software, such as GCC. It does these things all by itself:

* Get the tar balls from FTP / HTTP sites
* Extract them
* Auto-download and build dependencies, if needed and wherever possible.
* Configure, make, make install

The fetch-build-install cycle also handles the following software:
Boost -- C++ libraries
Boehm -- garbage collector in C++
Emacs -- the kitchen-sink editor
GCC -- GNU Compiler Collection
GDB -- GNU Debugger
GDC -- compiler for D programming language
GSL -- GNU Scientific Library, also Fortran bindings to it.
Lisp -- Embeddable Common Lisp, both compiler and interpreter.
FFTW -- Fast Fourier Transform in the West
LAPACK -- the old-is-gold matrix library, also BLAS, pure Fortran.
LLVM -- High-class alternative to GCC
Octave -- Matlab-clone
OpenMPI -- for parallelism in C++ / Fortran
Python -- 2.x, 3.x, Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib

... and many other supporting software libs.

You need to change the paths at the top of the script for your own
needs. Tested on Ubuntu 11.10 and Debian Squeeze, 64-bit.
