This shell script fetches the latest weekly build (snapshot) of GCC.
It does these things all by itself:

* Get the tar balls from FTP / HTTP sites
* Extract them
* Configure, make, make install

The fetch-build-install cycle also handles GDB, GMP, MPFR, MPC and
OpenMPI.

You need to change the paths at the top of the script for your own
needs. Tested on Ubuntu 10.10
